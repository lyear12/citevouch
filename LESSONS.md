# Lessons from merged work

<!-- reviewed-through: none (pre-1.0, no nightly review yet) -->

`citevouch` is written, reviewed and released by agents. Each night the day's commits are reviewed
for what had to be fixed again, what should not have merged, and what was verified too thinly. What
we learned is kept here. Read this before changing code.

Each lesson is a rule, then why, then the evidence. "Seen" counts the separate days a review found
it. A lesson seen on three or more separate days moves into [docs/code-standards.md](docs/code-standards.md).

This file starts from the lessons that were already paid for during the first build of the tool,
before any nightly review existed. The evidence below is real: each entry names the file or the
command output that produced it.

## Reading this file

Newest first. When a lesson stops being possible — because the code moved or the rule became a
test — delete it and say which test replaced it. A lesson that no longer maps to code is worse than
no lesson, because the next agent will follow it somewhere it does not apply.

## Fix the class, not the sample

**Rule.** When a bug shows up in one place, find the other places with the same shape before
writing the fix, and fix them in the same commit.

**Why.** A bug found by a real manuscript is a sample of a class. Fixing the sample means the next
manuscript finds the class again, and the fix cost is paid twice.

**Evidence.** A real 39-entry bibliography parsed as **one entry**. The cause was `_strip_comments`
treating every `%` as a comment even inside a field value: `note = {… 78.5%, 高于 CRF 基线 4.5 个
百分点}` was truncated at the `%`, which ate the closing brace, which swallowed every entry after
it. The sample fix would have been "escape the percent". The class fix — decide comment-ness by
brace depth and quote state, not by the character — is what shipped. Seen 1.

## A test that passes for the wrong reason is worse than no test

**Rule.** After writing a test, break the code on purpose and confirm the test goes red. If it
stays green, the test is measuring something else.

**Why.** The suite is the only thing standing between an agent and a confident wrong change. A test
that cannot fail is worse than a missing test because it also silences the suspicion that something
is unverified.

**Evidence.** `test_whitespace_collapses_to_single_spaces` asserted `normalize("a   b\t\tc\r\nd")
== "a b c"`. The implementation returned `"a b c d"` — and the implementation was right, because
`\r\n` is a line break and the words on either side are two words. The test had been written from
a guess about the output rather than from a decision about the behavior. The fix was to correct the
test, not the code, and to say in the test name that a line break becomes a space. Seen 1.

## The path the user types is the path that exists

**Rule.** When a flag takes both a `--root` and a path, do not join them blindly. If the path
already resolves from the working directory, use it as given.

**Why.** `citevouch check demo/manuscript.md --root demo` is not a mistake a user makes once; it is
what everyone types, because the root is for *sources* and the manuscript path is for *the
manuscript*. Re-rooting it produces `demo/demo/manuscript.md` and an error message that blames the
user for a path they can see in their own shell.

**Evidence.** The first real end-to-end run failed with
`citevouch: manuscript demo\demo\manuscript.md does not exist`. The rule now in `scan._resolve`:
"A path that exists as given is never re-rooted: the file on disk is the authority." Seen 1.

## Two names that look alike are two namespaces

**Rule.** When two identifiers are routinely equal but conceptually distinct, keep them in separate
fields even though it feels redundant. Then default one from the other, never merge them.

**Why.** Conflating them produces findings that are technically true and practically wrong, and
those are the findings that make users stop reading output.

**Evidence.** A claim wrote `source=vaneecke2026cxn` (the local PDF) and the bibliography key was
`vaneecke2026learning` (the entry). The checker reported five `bib-key-missing` findings at `high`
severity for a manuscript that cited correctly. `Claim.ref` now exists separately, defaults from
nothing, and matching uses `claim.ref or claim.source`. Seen 1.

## Report a class once, not once per member

**Rule.** A finding that can fire thirty times in one run is one line with a count and a sample. A
finding that fires once is its own line.

**Why.** Output is a budget. Spending it on thirty-seven lines about an unused bibliography means
the one line about the missing quote scrolls off the terminal.

**Evidence.** The first run against the real bibliography emitted 37 `bib-key-unused` lines and
buried the single `quote-missing` that mattered. It is now one line:
`37 bibliography entries are cited by no claim: aboumikhael2025c2xg, beuls2021frame, … (+29)`.
Seen 1.

## Verification and recording are different verbs, and mixing them hides failures

**Rule.** The command that writes the lockfile may report problems but must not be the only place a
problem is reported. The command that re-checks must be runnable against an unchanged tree and still
mean something.

**Why.** If `scan` is the only thing that reports "the quote is not there", then every user learns
that a green `scan` means correct, when it means *recorded*.

**Evidence.** `scan` originally produced `quote-found` findings, which made the lockfile writer look
like a verifier. `verify` now owns every match finding; `scan` owns only what it can see without
re-reading evidence (parse errors, unbound markers, page hints out of range). `tests/test_scan_verify.py`
asserts the split. Seen 1.

## Deliberate red is a feature of the fixture, not a bug in the tool

**Rule.** Keep at least one failing case in the committed demo, and assert on which case fails.

**Why.** Everyone can make a checker that says yes. The regression that matters is the one where the
checker must still say no after becoming more permissive.

**Evidence.** `demo/manuscript.md` backs its `fcg-editor` claim with the wrong paper on purpose. Four
claims verify, that one returns `quote-missing` at `high`, and the run exits 1. `AGENTS.md` tells
every agent this must stay true. Seen 1.

## An error message that names the fix is worth ten that describe the failure

**Rule.** Usage errors end with the command to run next.

**Why.** A pre-1.0 tool has no users who have read the source. The message is the documentation.

**Evidence.** `no ledger at citevouch.lock.json; run \`citevouch scan\` first` and
`manuscript.md changed since the ledger was written; run \`citevouch scan\` to re-record the
evidence` both carry their own next step. Seen 1.
