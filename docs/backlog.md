# Backlog

The 30-minute heartbeat reads this file and takes **the top unfinished item** it
can finish and verify in one run. Nothing here is a wish: every entry names the
person who is blocked without it. An entry that cannot answer "who is blocked"
does not belong in this file.

Order is priority, top first. `P0` is a tool that lies; `P1` is a tool nobody can
start using; `P2` is a reader we have not reached; `P3` is that nobody knows yet.

When an item is done, tick it and leave one line saying **why it is now true** —
not what changed, but what proves the change works.

---

## P0 — the tool must not lie

- [x] **A quote that runs across a page break is reported as `quote-missing` (high).**
  A real sentence split between page 6 and page 7 returns `tier=none` from
  `matching.find_in_pages`, because every page is searched alone. An author
  whose sentence happens to straddle a break is told their citation is gone.
  *Who is blocked*: anyone citing a passage near a page boundary — i.e. a large
  fraction of real papers, silently, with no way to tell it from a genuinely
  bad citation.
  *Done when*: adjacent-page pairs are searched as well as single pages, the
  reported page is the page the quote starts on, and `demo/` still says
  4 verified / 1 missing with exit 1. Reverse check: disable the pairing and the
  new test must go red.
  *Note*: this touches matching for every claim. `README.md:20-24`,
  `README.zh-CN.md:15-19` and `tests/test_readme_example.py` pin the demo output
  and must be re-read before shipping.
  **Done — why it is now true:** `matching._page_pairs` stitches every adjacent
  pair with a space between the halves and searches them after every single page
  has missed; `Match.spans_to` names the page it runs onto, and `verify` accepts
  either page as "not moved" and reads the number check on both. Proved by
  `tests/test_cross_page.py` (10) and `tests/test_cross_page_real.py` (3, whose
  premise test fails if the fixture paper ever stops splitting a sentence at
  pages 6-7). Removing the stitching turns 5 tests red. demo/ still says
  4 verified / 1 missing / exit 1, and the two README example blocks and
  `tests/test_readme_example.py` needed no change because no demo quote crosses
  a page break.

- [x] **`docs/metrics.md` does not exist.**
  Nobody can tell whether any of this works.
  *Who is blocked*: the maintainer, i.e. me — without a written record every
  claim about progress is a memory.
  *Done when*: the file exists with star/fork/watcher/issue counts, publish
  download counts, and one dated row per heartbeat that actually changed
  something.
  **Done — why it is now true:** `docs/metrics.md` carries the three `gh api`
  invocations that produce every number in it, the first dated row (0 stars,
  0 forks, 0 issues, 6 downloads across 16 releases, PyPI 404), and the three
  pre-committed readings of a month with no movement, each with a different
  next step so the decision is not made by whoever is most tired that day.

## P1 — nobody can start using it

- [x] **`citevouch draft` does not exist.**
  A real manuscript needs 100+ hand-written `claim` blocks. Anyone who is not
  already obsessive quits at the second one.
  *Who is blocked*: every prospective user with an existing manuscript.
  *Done when*: `citevouch draft paper.md --bib refs.bib -o proposals.md` turns
  an existing manuscript into reviewable claim blocks (sentence split → pick
  candidates → resolve source via manifest key, bib `file` field, or same-named
  bib key → locate the passage → emit `<!-- confidence: ... -->`), never edits
  the manuscript, always exits 0, and says "no local file" rather than guessing.
  Reverse check: each new test red before, green after.
  *Done*: `draft` exists with `-o/--force/--bib/--source/--root`; it
  resolves a key through the manifest, a bib `file` field (Zotero
  `:path:mime` unwrapped) or a file named after the key, and records the
  path relative to the root so the proposal is committable. Three things
  were only found by running it on the real papers: quotes taken out of a
  results table (`_is_passage`), words split by the column wrap
  (`_reflow`), and a heading glued to the sentence below it because a
  title has no full stop (paragraph-aware `_sentences_of`). Two citations
  of the same paper also used to get the same quote twice, which reads as
  a tool that never looked at the second one; the second is now a comment.
  418 tests; `tests/test_draft.py` covers each of those.

- [x] **`citevouch doctor` does not exist.**
  The first failure a new user hits is "it installed but found nothing", and
  there is no way to ask why.
  *Who is blocked*: anyone whose first run produces `quote-missing`.
  *Done when*: it reports pypdf presence/version, whether `pdftotext` is on
  PATH, whether the cache directory is writable, and the Python version, each
  with a plain "what this means" line, exit 0.
  **Done — why it is now true:** `src/citevouch/doctor.py` runs six checks
  (interpreter, pypdf, `pdftotext`, cache writability, manuscript, manifest) and
  prints a `fix:` line under every failure that names the command which would
  resolve it; `--format json|sarif` carry the same facts. `tests/test_doctor.py`
  (20 tests) covers a broken machine, a healthy one, and the README example, so
  the documented output cannot describe a smaller tool than the shipped one.
  Exit is 1 for a broken machine and 0 otherwise.

- [x] **No `action.yml`.**
  The Marketplace is the only place people look for "a check I can add to CI".
  *Who is blocked*: anyone who would use this if it were one line of YAML.
  *Done when*: a composite action takes `manuscript`/`root`/`fail-on`, runs
  `check --use-recorded --format sarif`, and a test asserts the inputs are
  actually forwarded rather than declared and ignored.
  **Done — why it is now true:** `action.yml` is a composite action with six
  inputs (manuscript required, root, ledger, fail-on, format, python-version),
  two outputs (`sarif`, `exit-code`) and two steps: install from the ref the
  caller pinned the action to, then run `check --use-recorded` with every value
  passed through the environment rather than spliced into the script. Exit 2 is
  re-raised as a failure so a missing ledger cannot look like a clean
  manuscript. `tests/test_action.py` executes each step's shell with a stub
  `citevouch` on PATH and reads back the argument vector, so the file is tested
  as behaviour rather than as YAML text.

- [x] **No `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`.**
  *Who is blocked*: anyone who gates their repo before pushing rather than in CI.
  *Done when*: one hook id runs `citevouch check` and its `files` pattern covers
  manuscripts.
  **Done — why it is now true:** `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml` carries two ids,
  `citevouch` (runs `check`, writes nothing) and `citevouch-record` (runs
  `scan`, writes the ledger), because one hook cannot both gate and re-record
  without turning "the PDF changed under me" into "the ledger now agrees" —
  which is the single failure this tool exists to catch. `files` is
  `\.(md|markdown|tex)$`, `pass_filenames: false` because the command reads the
  manuscript named in the config rather than the list pre-commit hands it.
  Proved by `tests/test_precommit.py` (13), which resolves each `entry` through
  a stub console script on PATH and asserts a clean project exits 0 and a
  drifted source exits 1 — the file is tested as behaviour, not as YAML.

- [x] **`pyproject.toml` declares an `xlsx` extra that no code uses.**
  `openpyxl` is offered as an optional dependency and nothing imports it. That
  is a promise to users and a false one.
  *Who is blocked*: anyone who installs the extra and finds it does nothing.
  *Done when*: the extra is gone, and `LESSONS.md` carries the lesson that an
  advertised capability is code, not configuration.
  **Done — why it is now true:** the extra is removed and `tests/test_extras.py`
  reads `[project.optional-dependencies]` with a small parser of its own (no
  `tomllib`, which would have made the guard uncollectable on 3.10) and fails if
  any extra names a module that nothing under `src/` imports. Putting the old
  line back turns two tests red.

- [ ] **PyPI has no `citevouch`.** `https://pypi.org/pypi/citevouch/json` → 404.
  *Who is blocked*: every stranger. `pip install citevouch` is the whole
  onboarding for this class of tool.
  *Done when*: either the trusted publisher is registered (needs the owner's
  PyPI account — a human step, not a code step) or `docs/maintenance.md`
  carries the exact click-path so the human step takes one minute.
  **Half done — the click-path is written, the account action is not.**
  `docs/maintenance.md` now carries the five fields to enter
  (project `citevouch`, owner `lyear12`, repo `citevouch`, workflow
  `release.yml`, environment **empty**), why the environment must stay empty
  (`release.yml` pins no `environment:`, so naming one makes the OIDC subject
  disagree and the publish fails instead of skipping), and the two commands that
  prove it worked. What is left is a sign-in I cannot perform. The workflow
  already reports which of the two outcomes happened, so the state is visible in
  every release run rather than inferred from a 404.

## P2 — the audience writes LaTeX

- [x] **No LaTeX input.**
  Linguists and NLP researchers draft in `.tex` / Overleaf, where `\cite{key}`
  already states the binding the tool wants.
  *Who is blocked*: essentially the entire target audience.
  *Done when*: `draft --from-latex paper.tex --bib refs.bib` strips `%`
  comments, reads `\cite`/`\citep`/`\citet`, takes the enclosing sentence, and
  writes a sidecar `claims.md` that `scan`/`verify` accept unchanged. Synthetic
  fixtures only — this machine has no usable `.tex` corpus.
  *Done*: `src/citevouch/latex.py` converts the document body into the same
  plain text the Markdown path reads, and `draft` calls it when the manuscript
  suffix is `.tex`/`.ltx`/`.latex` — no new flag, because a flag would let the two
  paths disagree. Why it is right: the converter is a character walker, not a
  pile of regexes — `\%` inside a comment is still a comment, a `\label{}` leaves
  no hole where it stood, and `$\alpha = 0.5$` becomes `0.5` rather than
  disappearing with the number in it. Why I believe it: 34 unit tests and 5
  end-to-end ones, and the end-to-end test was first written *wrong* — turning
  the conversion off left it green, because `draft` has its own raw `\cite`
  fallback. It now asserts two claim blocks and the absence of
  `\documentclass`/`~`/`\citep` in every statement, which does go red when the
  conversion is disabled.

## P3 — nobody knows it exists

- [x] **No image anywhere in the README.**
  Both READMEs are prose from top to bottom; a visitor has to read to learn
  anything.
  *Who is blocked*: anyone arriving from a search result.
  *Done when*: `docs/img/` holds a figure above the fold in both READMEs.
  **Done, except the GIF - why it is now true:** both READMEs open with
  `docs/img/verify.png`, the real output of a `verify` run over `demo/`, and
  follow the fifth claim with `docs/img/page.png`: the page that claim is talking
  about, the quoted sentence highlighted. Side by side they make the whole idea
  ("this sentence, that page") legible without reading a paragraph. Both are
  generated by `tools/make_figures.py`; `docs/img/verify.txt` holds the same
  lines and `tests/test_figures.py` reruns the demo and compares them, so the
  picture fails the suite when it stops being a picture of this program, and
  `docs/img/README.md` records where the excerpt came from and under what
  licence. The crop had to be snapped to whole text lines: a two-column page
  has two paragraph shapes side by side, so both a fixed height and
  "the block containing it" left a half-line sliced off at the edge.
  The GIF is deliberately not done - a recording has to stay legible at README
  width, and a blurred GIF is worse than two sharp stills. It stays open below.

- [x] **No launch material.**
  *Who is blocked*: the owner, who cannot post without text.
  *Done when*: `docs/launch/` holds `show-hn.md`, `v2ex.md`, `xiaohongshu.md`,
  `douyin-30s.md`. Publishing is the owner's decision; preparing it is not.
  **Done, and here is what each file is for:** `show-hn.md` and `v2ex.md` are the
  two that would actually bring people who will run it, so they carry finished
  copy, a claim block the reader can paste, the install line, and the two
  questions those audiences always ask (why not Zotero; my publisher wants
  LaTeX). `xiaohongshu.md` is two notes whose text never contains a command -
  the audience there is graduate students, not engineers, and "pip install" in
  the body kills the post. `douyin-30s.md` is a 30-second shot list for a video
  that is honestly not going to convert anyone: its own notes say so, and say
  that if there is one shot to take, it is the other two platforms. Every file
  ends with posting notes rather than ending at the copy, because the useful
  part is the part that stops a post from being a gimmick - do not lead with
  "an agent wrote this", do not put a link in the body of a Xiaohongshu note,
  run the demo yourself before quoting its output.

- [ ] **No video anywhere.** Deliberate for now, not forgotten: see the note in
  the figure entry above. A recording has to stay legible at README width, and a
  blurred GIF is worse than the two sharp stills that are there. Revisit if the
  README ever gets a full-width section where a 12-second loop can be seen at
  its real size.

## P4 — inputs nobody tried

These are not features. They are the shapes of input a real user's machine
produces, listed because each one is a place where the tool can come back green
without having read anything. Every entry here was found by asking "what file
would a person actually have on disk", not by reading the code.

- [x] **A file saved in a desktop encoding.** Notepad's "Unicode" and Excel's
  text export write UTF-16. Read as UTF-8 that becomes replacement characters
  and NULs, and the run finished green. Fixed in v0.19.0: `read_text` honours
  the byte-order marks and the NUL pattern, and `parse_bib` reports
  `bib-unreadable` (high) when a non-empty file yields no entries.

- [x] **A PDF that is a scan.** `pypdf` and `pdftotext` both return nothing for
  an image-only PDF, so every quote in it is `quote-missing` (high) - loud, but
  it reads as "your quote is not there", and the actual answer is "this file has
  no text layer". *Done in v0.19.1:* `source-no-text` (high) names the file, the
  page count and OCR. The interesting part was where the verdict is produced:
  both extractors return *successfully* with a list of empty strings, so the
  check cannot live in an except clause. It also has to run on the cache-hit
  path, because the cache stores pages rather than verdicts - judging only the
  extraction path would diagnose the first run and let every later run read the
  same empty pages back out and blame the quotes again. Three mutations are red.
  The fixture is a PDF written by hand (a page whose content stream draws a
  rectangle and sets no text) rather than one built with `pymupdf`, which is what
  the first version did: that library is not installed on CI, so the tests
  skipped, and the lint job fails on any skip.

- [ ] **A right-to-left manuscript.** *Unverified — needs a real Arabic or
  Hebrew PDF before this entry means anything.* The claim as originally
  written ("normalises to runs the matcher never lines up") is **not** what
  measurement found: an Arabic or Hebrew quote in a plain text source matches
  at the exact tier, and the failure that looked like a script gap was the
  digit system, fixed in `1a4230e`. What is still untested is narrower and
  different: whether PDF extraction *reorders* runs on a right-to-left page, so
  the extracted text is a different string than the one on the page. Nobody has
  evidence either way, so this stays open as a question rather than a defect.
  *Done when* someone with a real RTL PDF records what extraction actually
  does; if it reorders, that is a real entry and it needs its own design, and
  if it does not, this line is deleted rather than left to imply a defect that
  does not exist. Who is blocked: unknown until measured.

- [x] **A manuscript over a network path.** `\\server\share\paper.md` on
  Windows, or a file that disappears mid-run.  *Done 2026-10-31.* Windows reports an
  unreachable share as `ERROR_BAD_NETPATH` (53) and an absent file as
  `ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND` (3), and Python maps **both** to `errno.ENOENT` - so
  `Path.exists()` answers "no" to two different questions and every sentence about
  such a path said "does not exist".  `citevouch.errors.why_not_a_file` now reads
  the raw error and names the actual mistake (a directory, a missing path, a
  location this machine cannot reach); `scan`, `verify`, `check`, `report`, `draft`
  and `discover_sources` all route through it.  The same pass found a crash: a
  directory named `m.md` satisfied `exists()`, so `sha256_file` raised
  `PermissionError` and the traceback left `main` with exit 1 - the code that means
  "the manuscript has findings".  *Not covered:* a file that disappears **between**
  the extraction and the hash comparison, which no test can schedule; the sentence
  in that window is whatever the failing call reports, which is now the three-way
  one rather than "does not exist".

- [x] **A `sources.toml` entry whose file cannot be used.** *Done 2026-10-31.*
  Four situations - no manifest, a manifest without the key, a key whose file is
  gone or is a directory, and a manifest that will not parse - all produced the
  same sentence, `claim c1 names source='p' but no entry in sources.toml ...
  add it to sources.toml`, and in three of the four the entry **was** in the
  manifest.  The author re-read the one file they had got right.  The mechanism
  was one line: `discover_sources` filtered the manifest with
  `if path.is_file():` and no `else`, so the failures were destroyed before the
  message that needed them was built.  `read_source_table` now returns the
  bindings, the unusable keys with a sentence each, and the reason a manifest
  could not be parsed; `discover_sources` and `load_manifest` keep their old
  return shapes, so no caller changes.  Two tests in
  `tests/test_critic_round3.py` had recorded opposite conclusions about the same
  judgement - a directory given to `--source` is refused, a directory named in
  the manifest is ignored - and the ignored half is what hid this, because
  dropping an entry produces nothing to read.  *Done when* the sentence names
  the cause: `sources.toml maps 'p' to 'gone.txt', but 'gone.txt' does not
  exist`, `'.' is a directory, not a file`, `the manifest could not be read:
  sources.toml could not be read as TOML (...)`.  *Also done:* `verify` told a
  different story about the same project - `source 'p' cannot be found any
  more` - because each reader built its own sentence from its own copy of the
  mapping.  Both now ask `sources.explain_unresolved`, and a key nobody named
  keeps the old sentence because there is nothing better to say.  *Also done:*
  `draft` was a third opinion, saying `no local file: not in sources.toml, no
  'file' field in the bibliography, and no file named after the key` - three
  searches, one of which had in fact succeeded.  It now asks the same
  function.  Its resolution order is unchanged and correct: a manifest entry,
  then the bibliography's `file` field, then a file whose stem is the key, so
  only a key that resolves *nowhere* reaches the sentence at all.  *Also
  covered (second pass, same day):* a key bound twice. A `--source` flag that
  bound one key against a `sources.toml` entry for the same key resolved to the
  manifest, silently; two `--source` flags whose files share a stem resolved to
  the second one, silently. In both cases the quote was then searched for in
  the file the caller had just tried to stop using, and the finding said the
  quote was missing. `read_source_table` now raises `UsageError` when two
  different files claim one key, and stays quiet when the two paths resolve to
  the same file - so `--source papers/x.pdf` on a manifest entry that already
  points there is still fine. Refusing is not the same as deciding which side
  wins: both files are visible to the caller and neither is to the tool.

- [x] **Two `sources` manifests on disk, and the name a message uses.**
  *Done 2026-10-31.* Same shape as the key-bound-twice entry above, one level
  up: two files that each claim the role of "the manifest" cannot be ranked,
  only refused. `read_manifest` returned whichever name came first in
  `MANIFEST_NAMES` and never mentioned the other, so a tree holding a stale
  `sources.json` beside its live `sources.toml` was resolved against one of
  them at random - swapping the two files' contents flipped which one
  decided - and the losing file was invisible in every message, including the
  one telling the author to add an entry they had already added. It now
  enumerates the candidates before opening either and refuses with both names
  and a choice (delete one, or merge), because which manifest is
  authoritative is a fact the checkout knows and the tool does not. The
  second half is the same defect one level down: the per-claim sentence
  hard-coded `sources.toml` in both halves, so a project keeping its keys in
  `sources.json` was told `no entry in sources.toml ... add it to
  sources.toml` - a file not in their checkout, and creating it is exactly
  what produces the refusal above. `SourceTable` now carries
  `manifest_name`; `scan._manifest_name` falls back to `sources.toml` only
  when no manifest was found at all, because that is the file the README
  teaches you to make. *Verified by:* `tests/test_manifest_message.py`
  `TestTwoManifestsAreRefusedInsteadOfRanked` (4 tests) and
  `TestTheSentenceNamesTheManifestTheProjectHas` (3 tests); three mutations
  each red - hard-code the name back in `scan`, drop `manifest_name` from the
  table, restore the ranking. *Not covered:* two manifests that agree
  key-for-key are refused too, deliberately - the tool cannot tell "same
  answer twice" from "one is stale" without reading both, and reading both
  is the ranking this removes.

- [x] **An empty attribute binds the claim to the attribute beside it.** *Done 2026-10-31.*
  ` ```claim id=c1 source= page=1 ` parsed as `source="page=1"`, so a block
  whose author had written `source=` and stopped to think was bound to a key
  nobody had typed.  `sources.toml` had no such key, and the finding read
  `claim c1 names source='page=1' but no entry in sources.toml ... add it to
  sources.toml` - a sentence about the manifest, which was correct, for a
  typo in the block.  The attribute pattern in
  `src/citevouch/manuscript.py:_attrs` ended in an unbounded token, so an
  empty value took the next word.  *Done when* an empty attribute is empty:
  the pattern now splits on the author's spacing - no space after `=` makes
  the token the value outright (so `source=a=b` still means the key `a=b`),
  a space means a following `key=` starts the next attribute, so
  `source= page=1` earns `claim-uncheckable`.  *Verified by* three mutations
  that each fail only their own half, and by keeping the `a=b` spelling
  pinned: the first fix used one lookahead for both spellings and broke it.
